#+TITLE: UHID KEYBOARD

This is a small hack to send keystrokes via a UHID device on your machine,
I wrote this for only one purpose: controling my kodi instalation when i can't be bothered to get to the remote app.

it's mostly vibecoded in cursor hackstanding https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/refs/heads/master/samples/uhid/uhid-example.c
